# Sample configuration file for the 'booklist' script.
#
# The configuration file is expected to be in YAML format, which
# consists of tags followed by values.  For lists, such as the one
# for authors, each entry in the list is denoted by a leading dash ('-').
# Values can be enclosed in single or double quotes, or the quotes
# can be omitted.

# [Required] catalog-url is the URL for the library catalog search
# page.  It is most likely is not the same URL as for the library
# home page.  Note that that URL must begin with the scheme, i.e.,
# 'http' or 'https'.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
catalog-url:  https://catalog.library.loudoun.gov/

# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# [Optional] This media-type specifies the default media-type used to
# filter the search results.  If no default is specified, a default
# type of 'book' will be used.  However, the default type can be
# overridden for specific authors by specifying a media-type in the
# authors list.  Valid media types are:
#     book
#     electronic resource
#     ebook
#     eaudiobook
#     book on cd
#     large print
#     music cd
#     dvd
#     blu-ray
# The media types can be in upper, lower or mixed case as the case
# will be ignored.  Types that are more than one word can be enclosed
# in quotes or not.
#
# Note that some media types are supersets, i.e., a type of 'book'
# includes 'large print' books.  A type of 'electronic resource'
# includes 'ebook'.

media-type:   book

# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# [Required] authors is the list of authors to search.  For each
# author, a firstname and lastname is required.  An optional media-type
# can be specified; if given, it will only be used to filter the
# search results for that author.
